# what-s-new in weigo's stuff -
review for plans for Expectations in weigo's projects  



is just been year since the project inspection , now in this post

i'm gonna be working and maintaining the weigo's projecs if i had the perfect time to do it

the reasion why i'm sometimes being late or not able to do or even woriking in my projects and stuff 

because of high school homework & tests stuff
thats why I was not able to post someting in the end of 2021

this year im gonna be working well to do my best as i can, as well in my career becuse i'm sure i'm just well be best at it 
because i'm like to do it and invent it and make it.

who i am

i'm an independent software developer in sultanate of oman live in Al Buraimi Governorate

software engineering and creation of computer software is my favorite stuff im my live career

i started it since age 16 in early 2020s

with learning assembly language (alone) & pyhton programing stuff at Tenth Grade

And i was learning little about android appilcation development using java language about a two years ago
 and my favorite integrated development environment (IDE) for everyting is visual studio
 and i'm a C++ programer i just beginning to using it and learning it a lot since my inspection of my project in late 2021
 since c++ is yet great programing language to set smoothly underneath the hardware itself like C does in the 1970s & Now.
 
 what's is weigo
 
 is a collection of free creative & innovative computer software projects which can be used as as next-gen computing Platform
